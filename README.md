# hello-github
This is my first repo.
This repo is going to serve as a baseline for all future github projects. 

My current background consists of working in the manufacturing world as an engineering technician/Mechanical designer. 
I wish to change things up, as this world consistently lacks people who can communicate effectively. 

My goal is to create a clear timeline of events for anyone to see the progress of then vs now in this space. 
My current estimated timeline to acceptable junior level work is 6 months from now. 

That puts my goal date at 5/1/2026 

Wish me luck and in turn I wish you luck!
